# Math-Attack
Basic Gameplay
Intro:
A 2D megaman-like game where you go fight through several bosses, with each boss giving you items that will be helpful in the next boss fight. (Another similar example would be cuphead). The theme is math teachers at Harvard-Westlake, with the bosses being math teachers and the player being a student.
